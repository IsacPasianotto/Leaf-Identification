# Final project for the course "Introduction Machine Learning and Evolutionary Robotics" 

This repository contains the final project for the course "Introduction Machine Learning and Evolutionary Robotics" that I took at the University of Trieste in the academic year 2022/2023 for the master's degree in [Data Science and Scientific Computing](https://dssc.units.it/).

It was done according to the [given specifications](https://medvet.inginf.units.it/teaching/2223-intro-ml-er/project/) and it was developed as a work group with [Davide Rossi](https://github.com/DavideRossi1/). \
All the details about the project can be found in the [report](./report.pdf). 

The results written in the report can be reproduced (with some differences due to the randomness) by running the [script.r](./script.r) file with the R software: 

```bash
Rscript script.r
```
The needed packages are the following:

- `tree`
- `randomForest`
- `caret`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`
- `ggplot2`
